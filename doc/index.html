<h2>Disclaimer</h3><hr>
<p>
    Use the information presented within <b><font color="red">at your own risk</font></b>.
    Some steps will involve modifying your operating system's settings,
    adding devices to your computer, and handling of electronic components.<br>
    Please take all proper precautions necessary.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Overview</h3><hr>

<p>
    You'll need to provide the following:
</p>

<b>USB cable</b>
<p>
    "A"-type male connector to "B"-type male connector.
</p>

<b>DC power supply</b>
<p>
    Only use a <u><font color="red"><b>+9V DC regulated power supply, around 800mA</b></font></u>.
    The power jack accepts a 2.1mm male connector, <u><font color="red"><b>negative tip, positive sleeve</b></font></u>.
</p>
<p>
    This is identical to the power supply used in the Sega Master System.<br>
    I would recommend plugging it into a power strip with a switch so you can easily turn the PAL reader on and off.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Device Support</h3><hr>

<p>
    The PAL analysis hardware and software supports programmable logic
    devices, either PAL or GAL, that conform to the 16V8 pinout, that is:
    <ul>
        <li> Pins 1-9 are inputs.
        <li> Pins 11-19 are inputs, outputs or bidirectional.
        <li> Pin 10 is ground, pin 20 is 5.0V.<br>
             3.3V devices are <b>NOT</b> supported.
    </ul>

    This includes devices such as:
    <ul>
        <li> 10L4, 10L6, 10L8
        <li> 12L4, 12L6, 12L8
        <li> 16L4, 16L6, 16L8
        <li> 16V8 (when not configured as registered)
        <li> 18CV8 (when not configured as registered)
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>PAL types</h3>

<p>
    Programmable logic devices primarily come in two types: combinatorial or registered.
    Only combinatorial devices are supported.
</p>
<p>
    Any PAL with an "L" in its device name, such as PAL16<b>L</b>8, PALCE12<b>L</b>4, is combinatorial only.<br>
    Any PAL with an "R" in its device name, such as PAL16<b>R</b>8, PALCE12<b>R</b>4, is is registered or a partially registered/combinatorial. <b><font color="red">These are NOT supported</font></b> <br>
    Any PAL with an "V" in its device name, such as GAL16<b>V</b>8 can be configured as combinatorial, registered, or partially combinatorial/registered. <b><font color="red">Only combinatorial configurations are supported</font></b> <br>
</p>

<p>
    16V8 and 18CV8 devices are a superset of the PAL architecture and can be programmed to be combinatorial and/or registered.
    The analysis software will try to detect the attributes that a registered PAL would have,
    and warn you if it suspects the PAL is configured as registered.
</p>

<p>
    One way to determine if a 16V8-type PAL is registered is to examine its connections on the PCB.
    All registered PALs use pin 1 exclusively as a clock input, and pin 11 exclusively as an active-low output enable.
    A common scenario for registered PALs is to have pin 11 tied to ground so the outputs are permanently enabled.
    Pin 1 may be tied to a nearby clock signal, though it isn't always easy to tell.
</p>

<p>
    18CV8 devices, depending on how they are programmed, may not be detectable as being registered even when they are.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Driver Installation</h2><hr>

<h3>Uninstall old drivers</h3>
<p>
    If you have an older FTDI driver installed, you <b>may</b> need to uninstall it.<br>
    Select "Add/Remove Programs" from the Control Panel, look for "FTDI USB Serial Converter Drivers", and choose "Change/Remove":
</p>
    <img src="img/ftremove.png"></img>
<p>
    After it has been uninstalled, ensure no devices using FTDI chips are plugged in.<br>
    Then <b>reboot</b> your computer.
</p>

<h3>Install new drivers</h3>
<p>
    Download the appropriate driver archive from FTDI's "D2XX Direct Driver" page:

    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm">http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm</a>
    </ul>

    For example, if you are running Windows XP you'd want "CDM 2.04.06 WHQL Certified.zip" driver package.

    <ul>
    <li> Unzip the file to a directory, such as <b>"C:\CDM 2.04.06 WHQL Certified\".</b><br>
         Take a look in the directory, there should be .INF and .CAT files present.
    <li> Connect the PAL analysis board to your PC and apply power.<br>
         The <b><font color="red">red</font></b> LED on the PCB should light up.<br>
         Windows will recognize the FT2232 chip after a few seconds.
    <li> When prompted to install drivers, select the directory you unzipped them to and choose OK.
    <li> Windows should install the drivers and tell you that the device is now ready to use.
    </ul>
</p>

<br>
<h2>Tutorial: Reading a PAL device</h2><hr>

<p>
    Turn the power <b>OFF</b> before removing or inserting PALs into the reader.       
</p>

<p>
    To remove a PAL that is in the socket, insert a small flathead screwdriver underneath the chip and twist the handle gently to pry it up slightly.<br>
    The socket has a recession underneath the chip to facilitate this.
    Repeat the procedure on <b>both</b> ends until it is fully disengaged.<br>
</p>

<p>
    Always be <b>very</b> careful when removing or inserting PALs to prevent pins from being bent or damaged.<br>
    It's too bad they don't make ZIF sockets this small.
</p>

<p>
    Insert the PAL with the pin 1 indicator (notch) <b>facing towards</b> the USB and DC power jack.<br>
    Always make sure the PAL is inserted correctly or else it <b><font color="red">may be damaged</font></b>.<br>
    <b>Double check</b> that the orientation of the PAL is correct.
</p>

<p>

    <b>Revision 2 Hardware</b><br><br>
    <img src="img/r2layout.png"></img><br><br>
</p>



<p>
    Note the location of pin 1 and the orientation of the socket.
</p>

<p>
    Open up a command prompt and go to the directory that contains the <b>pd.exe</b> program. Then apply power to the PAL reader. <br>
    Windows may take a few seconds to recognize the device, and during that time the application will report that there are no devices present.
</p>


<p>
    When ready, type <b>"pd dump &lt;filename.bin&gt;"</b> and press Enter.
</p>

<img src="img/dump.png"></img>

<p>
    The reading process will begin and a progress indicator will be displayed.
    It will only take a few seconds to read the PAL.
    <br>

    I would advising choosing a filename that is the same as the part number of your PAL.
    In this example, the PAL was stamped with "D8L1".
</p>

<p>
    Now you have a binary dump of the PAL state. This is <b>not</b> a copy of its internal contents, but a collection of every possible output the PAL can generate for every possible given input.<br>
    The data needs to be analyzed to determine how the PAL was programmed.<br>
</p>


<br>
<h2>Tutorial: Getting Started with WinCUPL</h2><hr>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    WinCUPL will be used to generate fusemaps for creating replacement PALs,
    and minimizing CUPL equations down to more manageable sizes.
</p>

<h3>Installing WinCUPL</h3>
<p>
    Download and install Atmel's WinCUPL software:

    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=2759">http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=2759</a>
    </ul>

    The software is free, but you will have to register in order to download it.
</p>


<h3>Starting a new project</h3>

<p>
    Launch WinCUPL by double clicking on the WinCUPL icon on the desktop.
</p>

<img src="img/1designf.png">

<ul>
    <li> Select "File -> New -> Design File"
</ul>

<img src="img/2desprop.png"></img>

<ul>
    <li> Change the Name property to the name of your device. <br>
         For this example the PAL I am using is labeled "ROM1".
</ul>

<img src="img/3inpin.png"></img>

<ul>
    <li> Use the default of zero input pins and choose "OK".
</ul>

<img src="img/4outpin.png"></img>

<ul>
    <li> Use the default of zero output pins and choose "OK".
</ul>

<img src="img/5pinnode.png"></img>

<ul>
    <li> Use the default of zero pin nodes and choose "OK".
</ul>

<img src="img/6templ.png"></img>

<p>
    Erase the existing text in the edit window. Now we have our template for a PAL design created.<br>
    Note the path and filename shown in the edit window's title bar,
    this is where the output from this project will be written to.
</p>

<h3> Setting up options </h3>

<p>
    Select Options > Compiler > Output Files tab. <br>
    Check the checkboxes as shown.
</p>

<img src="img/opout.png"></img>

<p>
</p>

<p>
    Select Options > Compiler > General tab. <br>
    Check the checkboxes as shown.<br>
    NOTE: Make sure "Secure Device" is <b>not</b> checked.
</p>

<img src="img/cogen.png"></img>

<p>
    Select Options > Compiler > Minimization tab. <br>
</p>

<img src="img/comin.png"></img>

<p>
    I would suggest Expresso and then Quine-McCluskey if that doesn't produce the kind of results needed.<br>
    Change the settings based on what device you are trying to fit the design into.
</p>

<img src="img/coopt.png"></img>

<p>
    Change the settings based on what device you are trying to fit the design into.<br>
    Don't select "Keep XOR Equations" unless you are targeting a device with XOR gate support (PAL16X8, etc.)
</p>




<br>
<h2>Tutorial: PAL analysis</h2><hr>

<p>
    To analyze the contents of the data that was read,
    type <b>"pd analyze &lt;filename.bin&gt;"</b> and press Enter.
    The output will be written to stdout, so you may want to redirect
    it to a text file of the same name as the device.
    Use the <b>PLD</b> extension, this is the file extention for
    CUPL source code files.
</p>

<img src="img/analyze.png"></img>

<p>
    You can open the file in a text editor to examine the results.
    Here is the sample output:

</font>
</div>

<p>
    The PLD file contains a set of equations that represent the PAL logic and configuration in a format called CUPL.
    You can add "C"-style comments to the file, by prefixing a single line comment with <b>//</b> and
    enclosing a multi-line comment with <b>/* ... */</b>.
</p>

<p>
    The equations are series of statements joined with '#'.
    Notice that pins B3-B7 have a one line equation each, and pin B0 is
    a multiple line equation. Some equations can have just one line, or
    several lines, or several thousand lines.
</p>

<p>
    The CUPL file is the important part that describes how the PAL works. Fusemaps do not convey this information in a human-readable form, and they are tied to specific devices whereas CUPL presents the information in a more generic way.
    This also means the CUPL source can be used to fit the design that into other PALs or GALs if needed.
</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>
    You can and <b>should</b> document your work.
    Add comments to the file, including details such as:
    <ul>
    <li> Text from added markings or labels on the PAL ("SEGA 315-5220", "WH-02")
    <li> Manufacturer and part number (Lattice GAL16V8B, MMI PAL16L6BCN)
    <li> Device package (PDIP-20, CERDIP-20)<br>
         This information may not be present in the part manufacturer's part markings alone.
    <li> PCB the device came from, and its location. (Namco System 2 PCB, location 9K)
    </ul>
</p>


<p>
    You can add comments ot a CUPL file, such as what is present at the top of the output.
    I would strongly advise adding your own notes,
    this will help other people working with the same hardware to understand what the CUPL source code corresponds to.
</p>

<p>
    For example, this is how the above sample could be edited:
</p>

<p>
<div style="background-color:#E0E0E0; color:#000000; width:60%; font-size:8pt;">
<pre>
/*
        Source device:
            MMI PAL16L8, PDIP-20, stamped with "D8L1".
            Present at location IC20 on a Capcom CPS-2 "A"-board.

	Data source:
		d8l1.bin

	Device configuration:
		complex
    :
    etc.
*/
</pre>
</font>
</div>
</p>


<p>
    And don't just stop there. Now that you know how the PAL is configured,
    trace out the connections on the PCB. Write down the other components
    the PAL connects to. The PAL equations themselves are worthless without
    knowing how the PAL is connected to other hardware on the board.
    This is <b>not</b> the case with EPROMs and PROMs which sometimes are
    self-explanatory.
</p>

<h3>What Went Wrong?</h3>

<p>
    You may have analyzed a PAL dump and seen a warning at the start
    of the output that is similar to the following:
</p>

<p>
<div style="background-color:#E0E0E0; color:#000000; width:60%; font-size:8pt;">
<pre>
/*
	WARNING: The following pins MAY be registered:
		Pin 19 (B7)
		Pin 18 (B6)
		Pin 17 (B5)
		Pin 16 (B4)
		Pin 15 (B3)
		Pin 14 (B2)
		Pin 13 (B1)
		Pin 12 (B0)

	Analysis results WILL NOT be correct for registered devices.
    :
    etc.</pre>
</font>
</div>
</p>

<p>
    This means that during analysis, the utility found that one or more
    bidirectional pins had the attributes that a registered PAL would have.
    While this should be taken as a strong indication that the PAL is
    configured for registered operation, if you know for a fact that it
    is not, then consider this warning to be incorrect.
</p>

<p>
    The purpose of this warning is to help identify registered PALs which
    are unlabeled, or are similar to the 16V8 type which can be configured
    to be combinatorial or registered.
</p>


<br>
<h2>Tutorial: Minimizing equations</h2><hr>

<p>
    You should attempt to minimize any multi-line equation.<br>
    Here's the output from a PLD dump that is a candidate for minimization.
</p>

<div style="background-color:#E0E0E0; color:#000000; width:60%; font-size:8pt;">
<pre>
!B0	= !I0 & !I1 & !B1
	#  I0 & !I1 & !B1
	# !I0 &  I1 & !B1;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    To minimize this equation, follow these steps:

<ul>
    <li> Create a new project as shown in the WinCUPL tutorial. <br>
    <li> Cut and paste the output from your PLD file into the editor window. <br>
    <li> Select Run > Device Dependant Compiler or press F9.<br>
        It should compile with no errors.
</ul>
</p>

        <img src="img/suc.png"></img>

<p>
    Now open up the .SIM file which is in the same directory as the .PLD file,
    this directory is listed in the title of the editor window.<br>
    For example, if your PLD file is "ROM1.PLD", the SIM file is "ROM1.SIM".
</p>

<img src="img/simpath.png"></img>

<p>
    Near the bottom of the file, there is a section enclosed in "%EQUATION" and "%END".
    Within this area are the minimized equations.
    <br>
    Here's one of them:
</p>

<div style="background-color:#E0E0E0; color:#000000; width:60%; font-size:8pt;">
<pre>
!B0 =>
    !B1 & !I0 & I1
  # !B1 & !I1
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    You should cut and paste this in place of the larger set of equations that are in your .PLD file,
    in this case replacing the set of equations for B0.<br>
    Notice that the syntax isn't quite right for CUPL; change "=>" to "=" and add a semicolon at the end of the last line:
</p>

<div style="background-color:#E0E0E0; color:#000000; width:60%; font-size:8pt;">
<pre>
!B0 =
    !B1 & !I0 & I1
  # !B1 & !I1;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    Try compiling it again (F9). If there are no errors, you
    have successfully replaced the original set of equations with the minimized ones.
</p>

<p>
    This wasn't much of a reduction, just three lines down to two.
    However it's possible to have output that has hundreds of thousands of lines, and those can often be minimized to just a few lines as well.
</p>


<p>
    Some pointers:
    <ul>
    <li>    Don't try to minimize the minimized results.<br>
    <li>    If an equation cannot be minimized, even if it's fairly large, that's normal. Not everything will reduce.
    </ul>
</p>



<br>
<h2>Tutorial: Creating a JEDEC fuse map</h2><hr>

<p>
    Create a new project as shown in the WinCUPL tutorial.
</p>
<p>
    Cut and paste the output from your PLD file into the editor window.
</p>

<p>
   Select Run > Device Dependant Compile (or press F9).<br>
         It should compile successfully with no errors.
</p>
        <img src="img/suc.png"></img>

<p>
    Now we need to "fit" the PAL design into a target device.
    Typically any modern replacement of an older device will be with a
    GAL16V8, because it's reprogrammable, inexpensive, and functions as
    a superset of all previous PAL architectures.
</p>

<p>
    The PLD file has a <b>suggested</b> device type, though the actual device is set to <b>virtual</b>:
</p>

<div style="background-color:#E0E0E0; color:#000000; width:60%; font-size:8pt;">
<pre>
/*
	Data source:
		d8l1.bin

	Device configuration:
		complex

	Suggested GAL16V8 device type for WinCUPL:
                <b>g16v8ma</b>
    :
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    Edit the "Device virtual;" line in the source code to replace 'virtual'
    with the suggested device type, or whatever other device you are
    intending to use. Atmel's documentation lists which devices are
    supported by WinCUPL.
</p>

<img src="img/newdev.png"></img>
<p>
    Now try a device dependant compile again and
    see what happens (Run > Device Dependant Compile or F9).
</p>



<p>
    If compilation is successful, you will now have a JEDEC fusemap
    with the same filename as your project's name with a .JED extension,
    located in the same directory as your project files.
    This directory is printed in the title of the source code pane
    of WinCUPL, and is 'c:\wincupl\wincupl\rom1.jed' in my example screenshots.
    The .JED file can be programmed directly to a GAL16V8 part.
</p>

<h3>Verifying the replacement</h3>

<p>
    I would strongly recommend dumping the replacement PAL you made and
    compare the new dump to the original device dump. You can do this
    in DOS by typing:
<div style="background-color:#E0E0E0; color:#000000; width:60%; font-size:8pt;">
<pre>
    fc /b oldfile.bin newfile.bin
</pre>
</div>

    It will tell you if the files are identical or not. If not, then your
    replacement is not working identically to the original device and
    something is wrong.
</p>
<p>
    This is important as an imporoperly programmed PAL <b>could</b>
    damage the circuit it's plugged into. The PAL analysis board can
    handle any type of PAL programming so it will always be safe to
    read a PAL in it for verification.
</p>


<br>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2><hr>

<h3>"Error: No devices attached."</h3>

<p>
Check the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Ensure the DC power supply is plugged into an outlet, and the other end is plugged into the PAL analysis board.
    <li> Ensure the <b><font color="red">red</font></b> power LED is lit when power is applied. If it isn't, check your power connections again.
    <li> Ensure the USB cable is connected between the PAL analysis board and your PC.
</ul>

If you continue to get this error message, you will need to verify that Windows
has recognized the device.<br>
Download the <b>USBView</b> utility from this page:

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Resources/Utilities.htm">http://www.ftdichip.com/Resources/Utilities.htm</a>
</ul>

<p>
