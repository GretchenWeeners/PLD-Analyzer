 Overview of files

 /bin/pd-rev1.exe   Utility program for revision 1 hardware.
 /bin/pd-rev2.exe   Utility program for revision 2 hardware.

 I would suggest renaming the executable for the revision you
 are using to just "pd.exe" and putting it in a directory that
 is part of your "PATH" environment variable.

 /doc/index.html    Documentation and tutorial.

 /doc/project       PCB layout, schematics, partial documentation for
                    the revision 1 and 2 hardware.

 /util              Source code to utility program.
                    Define REV1 or REV2 at the top of shared.h for
                    the hardware version you are using.
